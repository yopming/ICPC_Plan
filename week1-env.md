# Week1 - Environment

Here is the contest environment:
* Languages: C, C++, Java 11, Python3, Kotlin
* IDE: Eclipse, VS Code (though VS Code is commonly called as an editor)
* Editors: Vim, Emacs
* OS: UNIX/Linux

In order to get familiar with the contest environment, I suggest you to do the practice under Linux environment.

The provided Linux distro should be Ubuntu, so we can install Ubuntu in the virtual machine or actual physical machine.

## Preparation

* Ubuntu can be downloaded from
  * arm64 version: [Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 arm64](https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/jammy/daily-live/current/jammy-desktop-arm64.iso)
  * amd64 version: [Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 amd64](https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/jammy/daily-live/current/jammy-desktop-amd64.iso)
  * Apple M1/M2/M3 computers should use arm64 version, almost all Windows computers should use the amd64 version.
* Suggested Virtual Machine: VMWare Workstation on Windows, VMWare Fusion on macOS
  * Virtualbox is also free, but VMWare products have better performance
  * VMWare virtual machines are free to personal use right now.
  * They can be downloaded here: [OneDrive share](https://broncosuncfsu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/tgeng_uncfsu_edu/Documents/Share/CSC312?csf=1&web=1&e=UWnWkL)
    * Because of security policy, rename the extension name for VMWare Workstation under Windows
