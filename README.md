# ICPC Preparation

This plan has been developed to learn algorithms to use in ICPC, **but can also be used for:**

- Practicing for job interviews
- Improving Algorithmic Thinking
- Practicing for College Classes

You don't need to strictly follow the weekly plan since we don't have that much time. Just spend as much time as possible. There will be at least one week between the team members and the coach.

## Resources

Here are some of the websites/tools that we use through this plan:

* [https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/)
* [https://open.kattis.com/](https://open.kattis.com/)
* [https://codeforces.com/](https://codeforces.com/)

## Topics

Here are the topics we currently include in the plan:

* Arrays and strings
* Hashing
* Linked lists
* Stacks and queues
* Trees and graphs
* Heaps
* Greedy
* Binary Search
* Backtracking
* ...
